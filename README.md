# Weather Report

This is the github repository for the Weather Report assignment from The Iron Yard in Durham, NC.
The purpose of this assignment was to write a Python program which would interact with the Weather Underground weather information API. The task was to be able to return a variety of weather data for a given location provided by the user.

When running weather.py, you will be prompted to enter a zip code. Please enter a valid five digit zip code to see a printout in the console of the current weather.

Please note, the JSON files are included in the repository to demonstrate that I was able to download a sample set of data (from a Durham, NC zip code) to use for testing purposes (as opposed to constantly "pinging" the Weather Underground API.)
